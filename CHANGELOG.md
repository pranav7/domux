# Changelog

Every release has a section here, newest first, in the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
shape: a heading `## [<version>] - <date>` and, under it, `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`
or `### Removed` as the release needs. The release pipeline reads this file: the section for the
version being released becomes the release notes, and a missing or empty section stops the
release. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-11

The first release of the Rust domux. domux V1, the Go version built on tmux, is the v0.x tags;
`domux import v1` reads what it saved.

### Added

- A terminal multiplexer with its own core, built on the Ghostty terminal library rather than on
  tmux: a server that owns the panes and outlives the client, tabs, panes, splits, zoom and
  scrollback, and a client that holds the terminal.
- Projects and workspaces: a project is a git repository, a workspace is a long running git
  worktree in it. `domux open` registers a directory, and the Navigator lists every project,
  workspace and agent in one place.
- Agent records for Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode: one record per session, with its state, its
  place and the recap the agent wrote. `domux peek` prints them, `leader a` opens the agents
  overlay, and a red dot marks an agent that is waiting on you.
- `domux install <agent> --apply` installs the hooks an agent reports through, following the
  agent's own configuration directory.
- Stay awake: domux holds the machine awake while it runs, and on macOS
  `domux stay-awake install --full --apply` extends that to a closed lid.
- The mouse: the wheel, a drag that selects, clicks on the chrome, and a click that opens the
  link under it.
- A control API every key and CLI subcommand reaches, printable with `domux api schema`.
- `domux import v1`, which creates what V1's saved sessions describe.
- Release builds for macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux (x86_64 and arm64), and a curl
  installer that verifies the checksum and sets up the hooks.
